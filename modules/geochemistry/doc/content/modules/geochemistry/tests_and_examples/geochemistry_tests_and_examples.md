# The `geochemistry` module: tests and examples

The theory behind the `geochemistry` module has been described elsewhere.  It is hoped that the descriptions of tests and examples found below will help users actually implement their geochemical models.

Most of the tests and examples are drawn from [!cite](bethke_2007)

## Equilibrium models of various waters

- [Chemical model of seawater](seawater.md)
- [Water in the Amazon river](amazon.md)
- [Red Sea bine](red_sea.md)

## Models with redox disequilibrium

- [Morro de Ferro groundwater](morro.md)
- [Microbial respiration](microbial_redox.md)
