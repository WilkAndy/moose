## Terminology

### Moles

A measure of the amount of a substance.

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{number\ of\ moles} = \frac{\mathrm{number\ of\ particles\ (molecules,\ atoms,\ ions,\ etc)}}{\mathcal{N}_{A}}
\end{equation}

### Mole fraction

A measure of the amount of a constituent relative to the mixture.

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{mole\ fraction} = \frac{\mathrm{number\ of\ moles\ of\ constituent}}{\mathrm{number\ of\ moles\ of\ all\ constituents\ in\ the\ mixture}}
\end{equation}

### Molality

A measure of concentration of a constituent.

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{molality} = \frac{\mathrm{number\ of\ moles\ of\ constituent}}{\mathrm{mass\ (kg)\ of\ solvent\ (water)}}
\end{equation}

### Activity

Defined in terms of the chemical potential,
\begin{equation}
\mu = \mu^{0} + RT\log a \ ,
\end{equation}
where

- $\mu$ \[J.mol$^{-1}$\] is the chemical potential
- $\mu^{0}$ \[J.mol$^{-1}$\] is the constant number, independent of temperature, pressure, other constituents, etc, but which depends on the reaction in question
- $R = 8.314\ldots\,$J.K$^{-1}$.mol$^{-1}$ is the gas constant
- $T$ (K) is temperature
- $\log$ is the natural logarithm
- $a$ \[dimensionless\] is the activity

For species equilibrium reactions, the activity is a dimensionless measure of effective concentration of a constituent in a solution
\begin{equation}
a = \gamma m/m_{\mathrm{ref}} \ ,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the activity coefficient, $m$ is the molality, and $m_{\mathrm{ref}}=1\,$mol.kg$^{-1}$.  Usually $\gamma$ is not too far from unity, so activity is numerically close to the numerical value of molality.

For minerals in mineralisation reactions, $a=1$.



\end{equation}

## Notation

!table id=table:geochem_nomenclature caption=List of notation used in documentation
| Symbol | Units | Physical description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\rightleftharpoons$ | - | Denotes an equilibrium reaction, for instance $B \rightleftharpoons 3C + 2D$ |
| $a$ | - | Activity.  For species in equilibrium reactions $a = \gamma m/m_{\mathrm{ref}}$, where $\gamma$ is the activity coefficient, $m$ is the molality, and $m_{\mathrm{ref}}=1\,$mol.kg$^{-1}$. |
| $\gamma$ | - | Activity coefficient |
| $I$ | mol.kg$^{-1}$ | Ionic strength: $I = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}m_{i}z_{i}^{2}$, where the sum runs over the free ions in the solution, so neutral complexes are not counted. |
| $I_{s}$ | mol.kg$^{-1}$ | Stiochiometric ionic strength: $I_{s} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}m_{i}z_{i}^{2}$.  Here, complete dissociation of complexes is assumed, and then the sum runs over all ions in the hypothetical solution. |
| $K$ | - | Equilibrium constant for a reaction |
| $m$ | mol.kg$^{-1}$ | Molality |
| $\mu$ | J.mol$^{-1}$ | Chemical potential: $\mu = \partial G/\partial n$ --- the derivative of the free energy, $G$, with respect to the number of moles of that species, with all other things (temperature, number of moles of other species) held constant |
| $N_{A}$ | mol$^{-1}$ | Avogadro constant: $N_{A} = 6.02214076\times 10^{23}\,$mol$^{-1}$ |
| $\mathcal{N}_{A}$ | - | Avogadro number: $\mathcal{N}_{A} = 6.02214076\times 10^{23}$ |
| $z$ | - | Charge number of a substance |
