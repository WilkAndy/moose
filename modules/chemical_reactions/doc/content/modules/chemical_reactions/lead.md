# The geochemistry module

Author: Andy Wilkins

The `geochemistry` module is designed to solve reactive transport in geochemical systems.  The `geochemistry` module is currently in development.  The documentation describes the module's functionality, but does not currently include any description of the MOOSE implementation.

The functionality of the `geochemistry` module is currently focussed on simulation of GeoTES systems, which operate between around $25^{\circ}$C and $300^{\circ}$C.  This means, for instance, that there are no plans to implement the virial Pitzer/HMW models for activity.  The `geochemistry` module's functionality is a subset of that described in [!cite](bethke_2007).

I have tried to write thorough documentation that is understandable to someone with no background in (geo)chemistry.  The `geochemistry` module consists of two broad parts: the reactions and the transport.

## Reactions

- [An introduction to equilibrium reactions, equilibrium constants, etc](equilibrium_reactions.md)
- [The database](database.md)
- [Equilibrium in aqueous solutions, sorption, mathematical equations and the numerical solution procedure](equilibrium.md)
- [Kinetics](kinetics.md)
- [Activity coefficients](activity_coefficients.md) and [gas fugacity](fugacity.md)
- [The chemical component basis](basis.md) and [basis swaps](swap.md)
- [Reaction paths available in the `geochemistry` module](reaction_paths.md)
- [Definitions of chemistry terminology and notation used](nomenclature.md)

## Transport
